Our recent work was recently published on *Nature* with title "A Dynamically Peprogrammable Surface with Self-Evolving Shape Morphing". Check details on *Nature* [website](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05061-w). 

In this article, we presented a mechanical metasurface constructed from a matrix of filamentary metal traces, driven by reprogrammable, distributed Lorentz forces that follow from the passage of electrical currents in the presence of a static magnetic field. The resulting system demonstrates complex, dynamic morphing capabilities with response times within 0.1â€‰second. With an in situ stereo-imaging feedback strategy plus a digitally controlled actuation scheme guided by an optimization algorithm, the surfaces can follow a self-evolving inverse design to morph into a wide range of three-dimensional target shapes with high precision, including an ability to morph against extrinsic or intrinsic perturbations.
