When backing up files, I used to just go with `cp` or `scp`. However, when transferring large amount of data, `rsync` turns out to be a better option as it provides additional features like incremental backup to minimize data transfer. This post summarizes some common use cases of rsync. 

## Most Common use case:

The simplest use case is:
```shell
rsync -azP dir1/ dir2
```

- `-a` is similar to `-r`. It's more recommended as it preserves symbolic links, special and device files, modification times, groups, owners, and permissions. 
- `-z` reduces the network transfer by adding compression. Typically omitted in local backup. 
- `-P` combines the flags `--progress` and `--partial`. This first flag provides a progress bar for the transfers, and the second flag allows you to resume interrupted transfers:

To just compare two directories:

```shell
# Dry run, send incremental file list
rsync -anv dir1/ dir2
```

Here, option `-n` means dry run, same as `--dry-run`. 

## Others interesting features:

By default `rsync` does not remove files in destination. In order to really sync between source and destination, `--delete` option can be used.
```shell
rsync -aP --delete source destination
```

Option `--exclude` can also be used to 
```shell
rsync -aP --exclude=pattern_to_exclude source destination
```
