The research was widely covered by news & media, including:
[Phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2019-11-tech-virtual-fingertips.html),
[Digital Trends](https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/flexible-wireless-epidermal-vr-john-rogers-northwestern-university/),
[Northwestern Now](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2019/11/epidermal-vr-gives-technology-a-human-touch/),
[Northwestern Engineering  News](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/news/articles/2019/11/epidermal-vr-gives-technology-a-human-touch-john-rogers.html).

Other than the mechanical modeling work, I was also in charge of implementing the harware control code and corresponding GUI showed in the demo videos. More details will be covered in a separate article.
