Our recent work was recently published on *Matter* with title "Synergistic Photoactuation of Bilayered Spiropyran Hydrogels for Predictable Origami-like Shape Change". Check details on *Matter* [website](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matt.2021.01.016).

#### Highlights

- Bilayer hydrogels exhibit opposite volumetric change in response to light exposure
- Coupling expanding and contracting layers generates synergistic bending with light
- Constructs exhibit light-driven locomotion and origami-like 3D shape changes
- Observed shape changes in designed constructs predicted by analytical modeling
